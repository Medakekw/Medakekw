I'm a 2nd-year Software Engineering student at Metropolitan University Belgrade who **uses Arch BTW** 😏.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on mastering **Vim** (why exit when you can stay forever?)
- 🌱 I’m developing on **Linux** because windows are for houses 🏠
- 💬 Ask me about anything, especially if it's about how cool **Arch Linux** is!
- Also doing random projects
